# AmesHousingData

The purpose of this repository is to showcase data visualization, data cleaning and machine learning techniques on the Ames
housing dataset

To view the code, data, and visualizations for this project, either clone it or open the file Ames.ipynb, which contains the 
most current version of the notebook and will (hopefully) load in the browser. Github sometimes has problems opening notebooks 
in the browser, however, so it may be necessary to clone this repository.
